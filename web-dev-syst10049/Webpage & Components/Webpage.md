A typical webpage has 3 components:

### HTML
[[HTML]] is basically the wireframe of a webpage, the backbone if you will. It provides a fundamental structure of where everything goes, what the hierarchy is, and where the other 2 elements go.

### CSS
[[CSS]] is used for styling, can greatly modify the page and can be used to do some really cool stuff (see Hoyoverse minigames / virtual conferences)

### JS
Javascript to add inteactivity

# Stages of Web Development Life Cycle
In short, SWDLC. 6 steps to every single web project.
1. Definition
	1. Why do we need the project? 
	2. Who is it for?
	3. What does it cost?
	4. How long can this go for?
	5. What does it achieve? (Cost and benefits?)
2. Planning
	1. Get a project plan and roadmap
	2. Get timelines, milestones
	3. [[#Visual Pairing]]: designing a site map and wireframe, get the face complete
3. Development
	1. This is the actual coding stage
	2. The team now works on the HTML page and add interactivity, add styles.
	3. If the project requires a backend, then Node.JS, Angular, etc. will be included.
4. Testing
	1. God I hate testing
	2. Bugfixing, etc.
5. Launch!!!
6. Maintenance
	1. God I hate maintenance
	2. More bugfixing

### Visual Pairing
We can't simply create a site from scratch in one sitting. We need a proper **sitemap**. To design the sitemap, we need to **wireframe**. 
#### Wireframe
##### Overview 
There are two types of wireframes:
- Low fidelity (Lo-Fi)
	- Basic structure
	- Use of placeholders
- High fidelity (Hi-Fi)
	- Detailed structure
	- Format of final labels
	- Use of placeholders
	- Images if possible
This simple wireframe can be made into a simple prototype without any JS, just to test feasibility.

##### Sketching wireframes
If you want a quick one then drawing on paper will be sufficient.
But if you want a good, interactive, and production ready design, you should use online wireframing tools:
- Wireframe.co
- Figma
- Mockflow
- etc.
