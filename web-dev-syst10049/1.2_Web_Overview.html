<h2>Introduction</h2>
<section id="page12"><!-- 1.2. Web Tech Overview -->
<h3>An Overview of Web Technologies</h3>
When we talk about web technologies, we're referring to the languages and frameworks you can use to develop web applications. There are a few very basic technologies that are common across most applications, and these are also the foundation of other tools and frameworks. Let's take a look.<br><br>
<section>
<h5>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h5>
<p><ul><li>HMTL is used to code the structure and content of a page or document.</li>
<li>The page/document structure is defined using HTML elements, such as the main body of the page, the header and footer, the navigation menu, sidebars, paragraphs and sections, and even this list of items you're reading now (it's called an "unordered list").</li>
<li>The text content is also part of the HTML code. All the words you are reading on this page that are not part of an image are part of the HTML code of this page.</li>
<li>Some HTML elements can read files or other media, such as an element that embeds an image into a document, or an element that embeds a YouTube video into a page.</li></ul></p>
<h5>CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)</h5>
<p><ul><li>CSS is used to code the style of a document, such as the colour scheme, layout, borders, fonts, etc.</li>
<li>Styles include hundreds of characteristics or properties that define the various colours for different groups of items, the way links should appear, the layout of the page and the spacing between elements on the page, how items should be formatted (for example, does an item have a border and what style of border, what colour of border?)</li>
<li>CSS can be embedded in the HTML page or can be kept in a separate file.  We'll talk more about CSS after the midterm exam.</li></ul></p>
<h5>JavaScript (no relation to Java)</h5>
<p><ul><li>JavaScript is a scripting language used to make a page interactive and/or provide some kind of functional component (which may or may not be obvious to the user)</li>
<li>It is used to create interactivity, such as that found with some web-based games or drag-and-drop photo albums.</li>
  <li>It also adds functionality, such as validation of form input fields (e.g. making sure a user chooses a valid username or enters a quantity that's more than 0).</li>
  <li>It can even enhance the style of a page, such as changing the colour or layout of items when the user interacts with parts of the page/document (e.g. when they click an image, you could put a border around the image and add a box shadow, or you could enlarge the image).</li>
  <li>It can also add and remove elements and structure components on a page.  JavaScript will not be covered in this course.</li></ul></p>
<p>These three technologies are the foundations of more complex tools and frameworks you can use to develop web applications. For example, JavaScript is the base for Node.js, JQuery, Angular, React, and Vue.js.</p>
<hr />
</section>
<section><!-- 1.2.1. Web Development Process -->
<h4>Web Development Process</h4>
<p>Many people think of web development as just sitting down and coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript or using frameworks to create a web page. In fact, the actual coding part of web development is one small part of several stages of the development process. For example, a developer needs a clear definition of the site's purpose or goal and who the site's intended audience is. A developer also needs to take time to plan out the pages in the site or application and define how they're linked together, as well as plan out the structure of each page or part of the application and determine and what kind of styling (colour, fonts, etc) the pages will have.</p>
<aside class="notice info">
  <div><span>Note!</span></div>
  <p>Is there a difference between a web site and a web application?
    There used to be quite a large difference between the two, but
    as web technologies and the abilities of devices evolve, the
    difference between a web site and a web application becomes less
    significant. Traditionally, a web site is informational and
    provides information or instruction, a presence (e.g. a company,
    a blog or news articles, a movie or tv show), or other content.
    A web application is more interactive: it allows users to perform
    tasks and manipulate items in the application. For example,
    a web-based game, a discussion board where users can create posts
    and add comments, a "front end" to a database (e.g. where customers
    can edit their credit card information, where a bar tender can keep
    track of liquor inventory, where a doctor accesses a patient record
    on their tablet, etc), a web-based tool or utility (such as a tip
    calculator, a bank's loan calculator, an imperial-to-metric converter).
    There are so many other examples, it would take too long to list them
    all.
  </p>
  <p>You can probably see that there is quite a bit of overlap in the
    examples I provided. Is a blog a web site or an application? Some
    web sites that appear informational might actually be web applications,
    and some web applications exist only to provide information on demand.
    In the
    grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter. Both can have
    static content (content that doesn't really change when the user uses
    or views the site/application) and dynamic content (content that
    can change while the user uses or views the site/application). The
    technologies used to develop a site and an application are
    the same, although you'll likely use more complex technologies to
    develop an application.
  </p>
  <p>In these tutorials, I'll use the terms <strong>web site</strong>
    and <strong>web application</strong> interchangeably: this will
    limit the amount of verbal clutter (it's awkward to read web site/application
    all the time) and remind you that the things we're covering in these tutorials
    can apply to both web sites and web applications.</p>
</aside>

<p>There are many ways to define the <strong>Web Development Life Cycle</strong>:
  if you perform an Internet search for such information, you'll find
  6 stages, 8 stages, 4 stages - lots of different ways of laying out
  the same information. Regardless of of how many stages a person
  is using to develop a web site, all the tasks and processes are the
  same. I've laid it out for you in 6 stages, but other resources with
  6 stages might combine "Launch" and "Testing" into one stage and
  split "Planning" up into "Visual Planning" and "Content Creation".
  It doesn't matter. It's more important to become familiar with
  all of the tasks that need to be taken and the order in which they should
  be performed.</p>
<section><!-- 1.2.2. Stages of the Web Development Life Cycle -->
<h4>Stages of the Web Development Life Cycle</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Definition</li>
  <li>Planning</li>
  <li>Development</li>
  <li>Testing</li>
  <li>Launch</li>
  <li>Maintenance</li>
</ol>

<h5>1. Definition</h5>

<p>The definition stage is the first and most important stage
  of the web development life cycle. If you skip this stage, your
  web site won't meet the client's goals and won't reach the
  target audience. In that case, the client has wasted their money
  and your time for a web site that doesn't do what they want.</p>

<p>The definition stage involves collecting and recording
  information about the client and the proposed web site.
  Why does the client want the web site? What is it for,
  what is the purpose and the end goal of the site?
  What content appears on the site and where does that content
  come from? You need to find out this information by talking
  to the client and the site's/application's potential
  (or existing) users,
  looking at any existing material (documents, an old web site or
  old application, catalog, files) currently being used.</p>

<p>Your information gathering should answer all of the following
  questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why does the application need to exist? What is its <strong>purpose</strong>? These
    should be worded as "ability" statments. Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to showcase and sell Client's custom crochet
        patterns to the community of chrocheters.</li>
      <li>The ability
        to showcase the items Client has made from their own custom crochet
        patterns, and to allow those who have purchased Client's patterns to
        show off their own work.</li>
      <li>The ability for Client's customers to share and request assistance
        and tips for completing patterns, as well as new ideas and alternate
        stitches, colourways, and yarns.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What are the <strong>goals</strong> this site should achieve (there should
    be at least 2)? Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>The goal of this site is to allow
        other yarn crafters to purchase Client's patterns so Client
        can make a profit.</li>
      <li>The goal of this site is to increase purchases and profits by
        allowing users to rate the patterns they've purchased and
        share pictures of the items they make from Client's patterns.</li>
      <li>The goal of this site is to build a close-knit community
        where crafters can feel comfortable sharing ideas and helping
        each other.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Who does this site serve, who is the <strong>intended audience</strong>? Example:
    <ul>
      <li>This site is for members of the crochet community that are
        interested in new and unique crochet patterns. Such users tend to
        be 45-75 years of age
        with a median income of $40,000 - $75,000 per year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>How</strong> does the web site support the goal of the client?
    How does the site help the client with their business, how
    does it provide value to the client? Examples:
    <ul>
      <li>This site provides Client with the
        ability to sell crochet patterns and keep track of transactions
        and customer contact information. The application allows the Client
        to receive feedback on the patterns, and then use that feedback
        to improve their patterns and therefore build a better reputation for
        providing high quality, unique patterns. The site
        will provide value-added for the client's customers who
        can see the results and ratings of the patterns before purchasing,
        view and ask for help and tips for completing patterns, and share
        ideas, all of which will help with building a community and encourage
        more purchases.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What kinds of <strong>content</strong> will the site contain and where will
    it come from? Will it be static and/or dynamic? Example:
    <ul>
      <li>The site will contain photos and text descriptions of
        available patterns. The writeups will be provided
        by the Client and edited by our team members. Photos
        can be provided by the Client and we have the option
        of sending our photographer out to get photos if
        needed.</li>
      <li>Patterns are stored as PDF files in a secure area:
        patterns can only be accessed after they have been
        purchased. Pattern meta-data will be stored in a
        database.
      </li>
      <li>The site will contain ratings, reviews, tips, assisstance
        and other information from Client's cusomters. customers
        will also provide photos of their own creations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What kinds of <strong>interactivity</strong> will the site contain? Example:
    <ul>
      <li>Users will be able to create accounts.</li>
      <li>Users will be able to purchase and download patterns
        in PDF format and also add ratings, comments, and post questions
        about specific patterns in a blog-comment style.</li>
      <li>Client will have a back-end where they can upload and manage
        patterns and pattern meta-data, manage transactions and accounts,
        and moderate customer-added content.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have these questions answered, you should have a clear
  idea of what the site is for, who the site is for, and what kind of
  content it will have. You would typically summarize all of your information
  into a report and hand it in to your client. Your client will review
  the report and ensure all the information is complete and correct.
  If any changes, additions, or omissions need to be made, they will tell
  you and you can update the report. The updated report
  is then handed in to the client for another review, and the process
  is repeated until the client agrees with everything in the report.</p>

<p>With you have a complete report, you can then move on
  to planning out the web site.</p>

<h5>2. Planning</h5>

<p>The planning stage shouldn't be skipped: completing this stage in
  full prevents mistakes and omissions during the coding phase. It also
  speeds up the coding process because much of the detail work can be
  laid out during the planning stage. The output of this stage must
  also be approved by the client before you're allowed to proceeed
  to the next stage.</p>

<p>Typically, the planning stage involves 3 smaller steps:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Project Scope:</strong> this involves planning out the tasks that
    need to be performed, in what order, and how long each task
    should take.
    <ul>
      <li>If you're on a team, who's doing which
        tasks? Who's in charge of content, who's in charge of
        coding the HTML/CSS/JavaScript/etc, who's in charge of
        setting up the database?</li>
      <li>In what order should the tasks be completed?
        Often a task can't be performed until another task is finished.
        For example, you can't start coding the CSS for the site
        until you've determined the colours, fonts, and layouts
        for each page.</li>
      <li>Timelines: plan
        out each task that needs to be done and how long each one
        should take so you can be completed by your deadline.
        This usually involves a tool such as a
        <a href="http://www.gantt.com/" target="extref">Gantt Chart</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Even if you're a team of one, you still need to determine
        the tasks to be perfored and how long each task should take.
        Clients won't recommend you to other clients if you're
        disorganized or late with your deliverables.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Content:</strong> create/obtain any content the site needs. This
    includes text, pictures, images, links, etc. Develop
    content to aid with accessibility such as
    captions for videos, text/audio for image descriptions, etc.
    Some of this
    might also be done during the Development phase.
    <aside class="notice import">
      <div><span>Important!</span></div>
      <p>It's important that you don't neglect accessibility in your design: you
        don't want to prevent potential customers/clients from being able to
        use a web application. We'll cover guidelines for accessibility later
        in the lesson on <a href="introPe.html">Progressive Enhancement</a>.
      </p>
    </aside>

  </li>
  <li>Visual Planning: designing the <strong>site map</strong> and the
    <strong>wireframes</strong> for each page in the site and determine
    the colour scheme or themes to be used.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Site Map:</strong> a hierarchical diagram that shows each
        page in the site and how it connects to other
        pages in the site. You can use lots of tools to create
        a site map, such as Microsoft Visio, or a free web-based
        tool like <a href="https://cacoo.com/">Cacoo</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Wireframe:</strong> a diagram that shows the layout and
        structure of a page. Wireframes don't contain actual
        content, but they might contain annotations that
        indicate colour or font. Most tools that allow you to
        create site maps also have the ability to create
        wireframes. <em><strong>(More on wireframe later)</strong></em></li>
      <li><strong>Styling:</strong> decide on the colour scheme to use for the
        site. This usually involves a minimum of 3 colours:
        a main colour, an accent colour, and a highlight colour.
        Ideally, you'll want darker/ligher shades of these three
        colours, also. The colours may be
        determined by a company logo or the client's personal
        preference, but you should also keep up with current
        colour trends: every year there is a new set of popular
        colours! Decide on which fonts to use and make plans
        for accessibility (e.g. a screen-reader-friendly version
        of the application). Determine the client's branding preference
        for the application (size and location of logo, for example),
        and determine how images will be displayed (thumbnail,
        with borders, etc). Ensure that all pages on the
        site have a consistent appearance.

        <aside class="notice questions">
          <div><span>Read!</span></div>
          <p>It's important to keep up with colour and other design trends.
            I like to use the following sites that are updated annually:</p>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_trends.asp" target="extref">W3Schools
            W3 Framework Colour Trends</a><br>
          <a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/color-trends/" target="extref">Canva: The biggest
            color trends in 2021</a></p>
          <p>There are lots of articles published frequently regarding colour and design
            trends, so do a web search once in a while and see what's new.
          </p>
        </aside>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have all of the site maps, wireframes, content, and styling
  decisions finished, you can start coding!</p>

<h5>3. Development</h5>

<p>This is the coding part of the process. In fact, this is
  only a small part of the web development process!</p>

<p>Development involves writing the <strong>source code</strong> that makes up the
  site's content and functionality. In this course, we'll be focusing
  on HTML and CSS, but in semester 2 you'll focus on JavaScript and a server language 
  to create more functional and interactive web applications.</p>

<p>Typically, web pages will include code written in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language, which defines the structure
    and content of the page.</li>
  <li>CSS - Cascading Stylesheets, which defines the thematic
    elements (such as fonts, colours, borders, etc.) and layout
    of the page.</li>
  <li>JavaScript - a scripting language that allows you to create
    dynamic and interacitve elements in your web application.
  </li>
  <li>Node.js, PHP, Perl, Python, or other server-side scripting language, which
    allows you to create dynamic and interactive applications using
    data that comes from the server, such as a database.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are also many technologies and frameworks based on the items
  above. For example, Bootstrap is a framework you can use to add
  CSS to your application and Node.js is a JavaScript technology that
  allows you to perform server-side operations using JavaScript code.
</p>

<p>The development phase also might include some content creation.
  For example, if your web site's content is driven by a database,
  you will spend some time in the development phase creating the
  database and populating it with the data that will appear on the
  web site.</p>

<h5>4. Testing</h5>

<p>Testing the site involves publishing the site to a small
  audience. This generally includes the client and a small selection
  of the target audience. These people are called "test users".
  Test users try out the site and look for errors, omissions,
  functionality that doesn't work, spelling/grammar mistakes,
  and other problems. </p>

<p>Testing is also done in multiple browsers and on multiple
  devices to ensure the site appears and functions properly
  with different software, on different computers, and with
  different devices and screen sizes. This also includes testing
  your application with accessibility software and uesrs that use
  accessible software and devices. For example, you'll want to make sure
  your page is screen-reader friendly and that any elements are accessible with
  both the mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p>Testing is a very formal process that involves developing and executing test scripts, 
  filling out detailed reports about any problems encountered, along with screen shots. Often the development
  team contacts test users for more information or to follow up
  on fixed issues, so being able to communicate well with users
  by phone, email, or in person is very important.</p>

<p>Once all of the testing has been completed and all issues
  have been fixed, it's time to launch the web site.</p>

<h5>5. Launch</h5>

<p>Launching your site involves publishing the content on the
  Internet (uploading all of the application's files to a web server).
  If the client doesn't have a web server, you need to provide
  one for them. They might wish to have their own dedicated web
  server or use one of several hosting sites available (for a fee).
</p>
<p>Once the web site is live, it's important to get feedback from
  users. You did this during testing, but it's possible that the
  test users missed something, or perhaps a different user finds
  an issue with the live site that wasn't an issue on the test
  site. Get feedback from the users in the early stage of
  the launch phase and make any necesssary changes.</p>


<h5>6. Maintenance</h5>

<p>Once you've developed a web site, it's not out of your hair
  forever. There will always be ongoing maintenance: users will
  always want some new feature, and more issues may be discovered.
  Web content is always changing as time passes: you may have to
  update text or images on the site as things change.
  And of course, you can always improve things: users might discover
  a feature is cumbersome and you'll have to make it more efficient,
  or perhaps a new technology allows you to do something in a better
  way.</p>

<p>Always ensure that any site you develop has a way for a user
  to provide feedback to the client. The client will inform you
  when they need to you fix, add, or improve something based on
  user feedback. In the meantime, you can move on to a new
  project. :)</p>

  <h5>Exercise</h5>

  <p>You've probably already got at
    least one idea in mind for a web site or application you'd like to
    create. Think about that application, and go through the
    first two phases of the web development process by filling in the
    answers below:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Project Definition
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Why does this web site/application exist, what is
          its purpose? Write at least 2 ability statements.
        </li>
        <li>What are the goals this web site/application needs to achieve?
          Write at least 2.
        </li>
        <li>Who is the intended user/audience for this site/application?</li>
        <li>How does this site/application support the goal of the client? </li>
        <li>What kinds of content will the site/application contain and where will
          that content come from?
        </li>
        <li>What kinds of interactivity will the site/application have?</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Planning
      <ul>
        <li>Outline all the tasks that need to be performed and in what order.
          If you're comfortable, sketch out the timelines for each task.
        </li>
        <li>Sketch out a rough site map for your site/application.</li>
        <li>Choose at least one page in your application and design
          the wireframe for that page. Think about the theme and
          colour scheme you might use.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

<section><!-- 1.2.3. Understanding the Web and the Internet -->
<h4>Understanding the Web and the Internet</h4>

<p>Many people mistakenly believe that the World Wide Web (aka "the Web") and
  the Internet are the same thing. In fact, they're not! The
  web is actually only a small part of the Internet. The Internet
  is a global network of computers that share information. The web
  is a part of that network that allows people to share information
  using hypertext (web pages and applications are made of
  hypertext, which are the pages that contain links you can click on).</p>

<p>Watch these two videos, as they define define this difference
  more clearly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onzTRvuOWSM" target="vid">How the Web Works</a></li>
  <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scWj1BMRHUA" target="vid">The Web is Not the Net</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is also important to understand how the Internet works. This next
  set of videos do this really well!
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/Dxcc6ycZ73M" target="vid">What is the Internet?</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/AYdF7b3nMto" target="vid">The Internet: Packets, Routing, and
      Reliability</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtu.be/kBXQZMmiA4s" target="vid">The Internet: HTTP and HTML</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After watching those videos, you should have a clear understanding
  of the Internet and the Web. Test yourself by making sure you know
  the answers to the following questions in your own words:</p>
<!-- TODO update the q'n'a -->
<ol>
  <li>Currently, what are the two most popular browsers being
    used? Do you think this means you should only design your
    web pages/applications to target the functionality/features
    of those two browsers?</li>
  <li>How does a page get loaded into your browser when you
    click a link/bookmark?</li>
  <li>What is bandwidth? How does it affect the loading of
    web pages and their files?</li>
  <li>What is the World Wide Web Consortium, what do they do?</li>
  <li>The word "Internet" is the shortened form of what word?
    What does that word mean?</li>
  <li>Why did Tim Berners-Lee develop a webbed system of hypertext?</li>
  <li>What is ARPANET? Why was it originally developed?</li>
  <li>Who controls the Internet?</li>
  <li>What is a packet? How does a packet get from one place
    to another? What happens if you want to send a very large
    file?</li>
  <li>What does a router do?</li>
  <li>What does TCP stand for? What does TCP do?</li>
  <li>What does HTTP stand for? What is HTTP?</li>
  <li>What does HTML stand for? What is HTML?</li>
  <li>What might a GET REQUEST be fore? What might a
    POST REQUEST be for?</li>
  <li>What is SSL and TLS? How do you know these are working?</li>
</ol>
