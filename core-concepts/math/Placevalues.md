Placevalues are powers of a system of which a digit can multiply with in order to occupy a *place* in a number. 

Common placevalues in number systems:
- Binary: $$2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3,... = 1, 2, 4, 8,... $$
- Decimal: $$10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3,... = 10, 100, 1000, 10000,...$$
- Hexadecimal: $$16^0, 16^1, 16^2,... = 1, 16, 256,...$$
