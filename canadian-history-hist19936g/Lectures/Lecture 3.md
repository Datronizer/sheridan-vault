# The first peoples before 1500 & 
Aboriginals did not have written history so we couldn't determine their exact history. We know that they were rational, advanced, long distance trades, etc.

# Society
## Private property
Private property isn't a concept that aboriginals have since it never made sense to them. Aboriginal society is focused on sharing property and land. Owning the land is like owning the sky, the air, the animals within it, the spirits within that land.

But the Europeans don't think like that. They

Society is more egalitarian than European history.

# First Contact with Europeans and the French in the Americas
## In the Americas
Introduction of European diseases killed 90% of the natives. Natives didn't have immunity towards Old World diseases so it caused them to contract diseases and die. The large number of deaths cause societal collapse as fear spread through societies. 

The natives lived in North America for thousands of years and have refined technology and agriculture, more advanced than most. They had elaborate belief systems and a strong social structure. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough.
## In Europe
During this time, Europe was in the Middle Ages. Society was simple, there were kings and queens, tsars, etc. and on the other end are peasants and fighters. If you can fight, you can acquire power. So to keep this power in control and protect the rulers, city-states used religions to keep the population under control. Religion played a much greater role back then than compared to now.

Europe was full of bloodshed between peoples and city-states. But there was one thing they could all unite under: The Catholic Church. The Catholic Church was dominant in Europe.

In any case, Europe was trading with Asia and has been doing so for centuries. But as the Ottoman empire rose to power over the lands of the old Byzantine empire, they cut off trades between the two continents. At the same time, Europe was falling apart as empires grew more competitive. That in addition to new technologies in warfare causes a decline in European society.

Around this time, printing was invented. This allowed the Catholic Church to print bibles and keep the population under control.
