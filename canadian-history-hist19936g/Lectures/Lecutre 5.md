# 1763 - 1960
## The Quebec Treaty
The British took over all the French territories and signed tha Quebec treaty to spare the French in Quebec from deportation. However, this didn't come cheap. The Brits in turn want to take hold of power within Quebec.

The French are removed from power in Quebec, and the French aristocrats and entrepreneurs are angry. This led to a 200 year struggle for internal power within Quebec before [[The Quiet Revolution]] in the 1960's. That's also why Quebec's license plate says "je me souviens - we remember" because you can never forget the sins commit against the French population of Canada.
## Lack of Representation in Government
Women can't vote, French can't vote, Natives can't vote. Only rich men can vote. But this was soon to change from a seemingly unrelated event--the American Revolution. After the [[American Revolution]], the British power in North America was weakened and politics started changing in Canada as an effect of the ripples.

The Royalists were people who were loyal to the British Crown and after the revolution and the formation of the United States, fled to Canada as refugees. And they fled to the newly segregated [[Upper Canada]] (modern day Ontario) while the rest of the French lived in [[Lower Canada]] (modern day Quebec and Labrador).

The refugees here stayed in York (modern day Toronto). And a lot of them brought family with them. With their riches, they became rulers of their local governments. Namely [[Simcoe]] %% Look him up after class %%
## Westward Expansion
Canada wishes to expand westward, but they cannot simply do that as they'll have to pass through Metis land. They must put these people down else they cannot push to British Columbia. 
# The Road to Confederation and Nationhood
Unlike the US, Canada's conflicts against her oppressor is mostly rebellious rather than revolutionary. By the 19th century, things shook up very drastically as a result of the 4th industrial revolution.
## The 19th Century
### Intellectual Revolution
New ideas started to emerge. Ideas about liberalism, conservatism, etc. arose from an improvement in lifestyle in Europe and rubbed off of the colonies. New classes were formed in society, like the Liberals who represent the professional classes like lawyers; conservatives represent the aristocrats; and the socialists (NDP) represent the working class.

People started questioning religion and politics as the new enlightenment started giving people the tools to do so. Society can now be studied rationally rather than through the acts of God. You need a statement, evidence, and reasoning. This is called the **Scientific Method**.

But from these intellectual thoughts, we start questioning our living conditions. We started building schools and using that knowledge to then plan out cities and help out the people.
### Free Trade
British Empire abolishes Mercantilism (trade within empire) in favor of Free Trade (trade outside of empire). The British used Mercantilism to give itself resources, but it needs colonies to do that. But they don't need colonies with Free Trade, this is one of the reasons the British let go of Canada, because it was becoming more of a burden than a source of income for the Brits.

Canada didn't fight for its own independence, but rather received it from the Brits who was done supporting the colonies.

The 4th industrial revolution is a game changer for modern society and it allowed us to reach levels we could not ever imagine. 

One of the best things to come out of this was the creation of new modes of transportation. The railway was one of the most significant inventions of the modern era. Through railway, one could reach further distances and conquer more land, carry more goods, allowing for greater and faster expansions.

New goods and services appeared alongside these new inventions. Public schools and medicine and prison systems are invented. New issues also arose such as overpopulation, etc.
### Revolutionary Age
This is when Canada is at the peak of conflicts. Due to issues with [[#Lack of Representation in Government|representation in government]] and voting rights, the politics started to shift. This led to rebellions throughout Upper and Lower Canada between 1837 and 1838. 

These are all independent movements, which started from similar causes (slight differences), and are aimed towards the same goal: **Responsible Government**.

In Lower Canada, French Canadian Nationalism was the driving force.

Obviously, since this is a rebellion, it didn't work. But it did come with some aftermaths.
- Many rebels are put on trial and executed
- French nationalism blamed in Lower Canada, American Republicism (yes, American) in Upper Canada
- Root cause of dissatisfaction remains
- British Government (Lord Durham) suggested allowing a limited "responsible government" and to anglicize the French
- 1840 Act of Union merged the 2 Canadas and assimilated the French.
