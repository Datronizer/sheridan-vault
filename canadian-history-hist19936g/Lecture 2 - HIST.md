# Historiography
We learn history to find the truth. And the truth is hard to find. Very hard.

Say the news for example. News aren't even reliable, let alone information 100s of years ago, 1000s of years ago. But through historiography and careful dissection of history, we might be able to see the full picture.
## Anachronism
You should not be taking the morals of today and reflect that on the past. Morals change, times change, it's different back then. You need to understand the norms and the context of the past.
## Victimization Thesis
You don't want to make victims. If you always talk about someone as a victim then you're undermining their efforts and history.
## Bruce Trigger
Rationalizes people and history to give a different perspective.
# Staple Thesis and The Start of Canada
Every country has an explanation for why their country is unique, not necessarily solely culture based, but rather socio economic based. This is called the Staple Thesis. Professor Efremkin considers socioeconomic issues rather than culture because he believes that culture changes over time while human needs like food, shelter, quality of life are generally consistent. He calls this "old Left" aka Marxist.

Anytime you want to look at a conflict, look at the resources. This is generally the reason why conflict happens. Second reason is Geopolitics. But money is the number one reason. Religion is more of an old reason for war rather than a modern one.

Harold Innis says you can look at Canada's Staple Thesis by considering what they are known for. The European colonists came to Canada in need of furs. Lots of furs, beavers and such. Unlike the US and South America where the Europeans slaughter the natives, in Canada it's a balance of power. Canada is a hostile land, and the Europeans knew nothing. The natives do. So an "alliance" was formed.

The Europeans give the natives guns and iron, and in return, the natives give back furs and guide them further inland to settle. It started in Quebec City, then Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, etc. This is why all the power in Canada are on the Montreal-Toronto line, because this was where it all started.

## Aboriginal Self-Governance
Natives did not have the concept of private property, but the Europeans do. So they kept taking land, and they take more and more. In the process, this displaces the natives from their ancestral lands, either by force, by trade, or by politics. So in a way, the Natives are the ones who really suffer the most in Canada, and they still do till this day because they are still being displaced from their lands and are systematically removed.

# Hybridity
Multiculturalism. Canada is officially multicultural, US is more multicultural, they just don't have policies, Canada does have official policies dictating it.

The Metis are half-french natives.

There was never a revolution in Canada, more like a rebellion. Canadian history can simply be described as colony to independence to colony. Canada for the most part is a colony of the US (I mean everything is dependent on the US).

# Civil Society
It's when people at the grassroots levels take charge and do something. Changes take place at the bottom level. This is something that does not exist in many countries.

Canada is technically still under British rule. But we're free after 1982. Now the Brits are just symbolically ruling Canada.
