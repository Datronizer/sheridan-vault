Every whole number $a$ in math can be expressed as $$a = (m*k) + b$$where
$$a, m, k \in \mathbb{Z}, b \ge 0$$


In human language, we can say that any number $a$ is equal to the product of some random whole numbers $m$ and $k$ plus a positive value of $b$


This is a long form of a modulo. To find the relation ship of $a$ and $b$, it would be better to have a notation as such:
$$a \mod b = $$

As such, we can say, for example:
$$19 = (3 * 6) + 1$$
