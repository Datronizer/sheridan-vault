The binary number system, as the name suggests, has only two numbers: 0 and 1. 

This number system was originally invented to bridge the language barrier between man and machine. Computers can only communicate in electric currents, which in turn can only either be on or off. Hence 0 and 1 are used to notate the presence of a current. 0 being no, 1 being yes.

As computers can only "speak" in 0s and 1s, we eventually had to come up with a methodical system to translate binary into decimal, and formulate the system's fundamental properties.
# In terms of pure math
The binary system, in terms of pure math, is just the group $\mathbb{Z}^+$. Whether this is [[Cyclic groups|cyclic]] or [[Hausdorff]] is unclear because I need my textbook, but I believe it does, since those are the properties of the group $\mathbb{Z}$, just "spoken in a different language". 

Example: $$
\begin{align}
17 + 25 &= 42 \\
10001 + 11001 &= 101010
\end{align}
$$
# In terms of discrete math
Binary is a centerpiece of discrete math as this is how computers communicate with one another. Lots of research has been done on the mathematical foundations of such a field, and generally, the information coincides with that of pure math.
