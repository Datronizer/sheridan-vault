# What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about building computer programs that act rationally (intelligent agents). AI is a computer program but not otherwise. AI distinguishes itself from mere programs by

# 4 Approaches to Artificial Intelligence
There are 4 approaches to AI, each of which represent a goal of some sort for computer scientists over time. These goals are represented in chronological order of when they were conceived.
## Thinking Humanly
**Cognitive Model Approach**:
- Mimic human thinking, by learning how human minds work
- Once we know how it works, we can express a program that represents that theory

Ideally, a complete model, when providing an input will spit back an output that resembles how humans behave.

Problem is humans don't often act rational. We're emotional beings and our decisions don't necessarily do things the way we expect them. So maybe, AI should be thinking rationally instead.
## Acting Humanly
[The Turing Test](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/) is an important idea in the realm of AI, because it is a basis on which we can determine if an artificial agent can pass as a human (is human enough that we can't discern).

There are 4 things that we can use to fail an artificial agent:
1. Natural Language Processing: Machines to communicate text, speech
2. Knowledge presentation: The act of storing knowledge
3. Automated Reasoning: Come to conclusions based on their stored knowledge
4. Machine Learning: Ability to adapt, infer, or detect patterns

There's also a Total Turing Test. As compared to the Turing Test which literally just involves conversing, the Total Turing Test looks as the full scope including physical interaction.
## Thinking Rationally 
**Logical Rules Approach:**
All decisions are made based on syllogisms, such as if-else, if-then, deductive/inductive arguments. 

This is a very bad approach since it's too reductionist and life is seldom as simple as the model suggests. In short: One cannot reduce all decisions to a set of premises and conclusions.
## Acting Rationally
You can't always prove a decision is correct, but you must choose. Not all rationality can be based on logical rules. Not all rational actions need to be logical.

This model is made based on the weaknesses of the prior models. This is the current approach for modern agents.
