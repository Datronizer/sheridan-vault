npgr doc, missing # of cashouts row

each member buys credit from a platform. We need a cashout tips, bonus rows.


# Premium pack
For Each of the cashin numbers, each platform has a different price.

example: buy mega spin, credit is $50, that costs $150. we dont know what platform what money is coming from.

WE need a bonus section to see where the money goes after. basically 10 goes in + 2 bonus => 12 to mega spin, but we only gain 10. 

basic shows income. Premium dashboard upgrade => show tips, bonus, platform costs.

tips come in, cash out 150 (wheres the tip in this cash out?), we need to track tips we receive from clients.
