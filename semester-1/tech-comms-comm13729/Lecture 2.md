We've all been exposed to writing throughout our lives. In terms of technical communications, these are considered essays. But what we will be doing in this field are different from that. Your works here will be more technical, well documented, like... documentations!

Your writings here is tailored towards the readers' needs, not the writers' goals. So how do we ensure that our technical writing meets our audience's needs?

# Meeting audience's needs
Differentiate between **effective** and **efficient**.
Efficiency saves time, energy, and resources for the workplace.
-> No reader should have to spend 10 minutes to interpret a 5-minute message.

## What causes inefficiency?
There are a few reasons:
- More/less info than needed
- More/less words than needed
- Confusing organization/layout
- Irrelevant content
- No visual aids
- Using jargon

Keep the technicality levels in mind as some users are more well versed than others => cater to their knowledge

# Elements of efficient documents
Content that makes the document worth reading
Organization that guides readers and emphasizes important material
Style that is economical and legible
Visuals that clarify concepts and relationships, substitute for words when needed

# Audience needs
As a technical writer, you'll need to consider your audience's needs. Think of it like interviewing for a job. The interviewer is looking for a good candidate for their job, so you must present yourself as a good candidate.
