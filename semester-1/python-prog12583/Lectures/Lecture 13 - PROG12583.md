# Objects
Since we have almost completed the course, let's have a look at what Python is specialized in: Object-Oriented Programming. 

To understand the term, let's look at objects. What are they? In the most general sense, my laptop is an object, my phone is an object, my desk is an object, etc. And what do these items have in common? They both "have" something, and "do" something. For example: my phone **has** a screen and it **does** the act of browsing the web. My desk **has** a surface and it **does** the act of keeping things on its surface.

You know what these objects also have in common? These objects have a relationship to each other. Let's say a chair and a desk. These are both a type of furniture! So you could say a chair is a furniture used for sitting, and a desk is a furniture used for working. 

Linking these objects based on their relations is called **associating**. Linking them based on their common umbrella parent is called **inheritance**. Like a cheetah, a tiger, and a lion. These are all subspecies of a cat. So they inherit attributes of a cat (the haves) and they inherit the methods of a cat (the do's). 

You could assign these relationships based on tiers:
- 0 - No relationship
- 1 - Has a relationship
- 2 - Is/Is a type of (inheritance)

Each of these big objects are like templates, their official name is a **class**. You can create smaller objects following these classes, these smaller objects are called **templates**.
