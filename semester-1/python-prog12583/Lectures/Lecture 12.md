Sometimes you need to read/write a file. How does one do that through Python? Well, thankfully in Python it's super simple.
```
# To open a file:
file = open('path/to/file.txt', 'r')   # second arg can be read, write, append: 'r','w','a'
file.close()                           # closes the i/o stream aka the file
```
