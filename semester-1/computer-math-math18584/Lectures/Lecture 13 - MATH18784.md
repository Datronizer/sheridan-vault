# Functions
## Definition
## Relations
### One-to-one relation
This is straight up the proper definition of a function. A one-to-one relation is a relation that maps 1 value of $x$ to 1 value of $y$ where for any different $x$ there are no repeating $y$.
### One-to-many relation
A one-to-many relation is a relation in which 1 value of $x$ maps to multiple values of $y$. This is of course, by [[#definition]], not a function.
### Many-to-one relation
A many-to-one relation is a relation in which multiple values of $x$ maps to 1 value of $y$. This is, funny enough, a function by [[#definition]].
## Different functions
### Ordered pairs

## Vertical line test
If I draw a vertical line at any point of the graph, and if the line passes through one or more points, then the relation is NOT a function.

This is directly from the [[#Definition|definition of a function]].

(Images will not be provided here but you are encouraged to draw/imagine the following equations):
- IS a function
	- Linear equation ($ax + b$)
	- Quadratic equation ($ax^2 + bx + c$)
	- Constant equations ($a$)
	- Absolute equations ($|x|$)
- IS NOT a function
	- Circle equation ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$)
	- "Flipped equations"
		- Sideways parabola ($x = y^2$) ^4

[[#^4]] This is funny because the square root equations $y = \pm\sqrt{x}$ are individually functions. But that kinda makes sense because you're splitting the original equation, which is in terms of $y$, into 2 functions in terms of $x$.

## Domain and Range
A domain is, formally, a set of all possible x-values of a function. A range is a set of all possible y-values of a function. (This is not entirely accurate, please refer to [[Functions]] for additional information.)

Consider the following relation:
$\{(1,2), (0,3), (-1,5), (2,3)\}$
- This is indeed a function
- The domain is $\{-1,0,1,2\}$
- The range is $\{2,3,5\}$

Okay, what about $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$
Well if we sketch the equation on a graph (add wolfram alpha graph here), we see that the x-values go from 0 to basically infinity. Same with y.
- In that case, yes this is a function
- The domain is $[0, \infty)$
- The range is $[0,\infty)$

Don't forget, we can use the [[#set notation]] in addition to the [[#interval notation]]. In that case, our domain and range are $D=\{x | x \ge 0, x\in \mathbb{R}\}$ and $R=\{y | y \ge 0, y\in \mathbb{R}\}$ respectively.
