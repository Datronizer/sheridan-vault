# Immigration

## Causes for relaxing Immigration restrictions
- Business Interests
	- Cheap labor
	- More talent
- Labour groups
- Church and Community
	- Humanitarian efforts
	- Post-Holocaust ripples
	- US Civil Rights pressure
	- Vietnam war ripples
- Ethnic Lobby Groups
	- Ethnic groups start lobbying for family reunion structures
	- More ethnic population means more immigration-leaning votes 
- Postwar Economy Boom and the Search for Skilled Immigrants

Thus, new immigration policies were enacted which increases immigrant population which influences future immigration policies.

## Globalizing Immigration to Canada
- De-racializing Immigration
- Cold war Context
- Economic Forces
- 3 Classes of Immigrant Entrants

# Cold War
Cold war is one of the most important global events. You could say it's one of the pillar events of world history, like Covid or post-9/11. Lots of things were changed during this time.

The world was politically divided into two during the cold war, and of course, this affected Canada also. As with every other big event, another group of people become the "bad guys". During the cold war, it's the communists and Russians. This much was familiar from the world war that just ended. Germany had been replaced by Russia, Hitler by Stalin, and Nazism by Communism. By 1949 Japan had been replaced by China in the East.

2.1 million immigrants enter Canada between 1945 and 1962 into 11 million. And a lot of these immigrants are deemed conservative, hot blooded, abusive, etc. A lot of hateful rhetoric and an attempt by the government to "re-educate" these immigrants in their vision.

Democracy and freedom of speech goes out the door in the name of security.

# Immigration (cont'd)
## Contemporary Immigration
### Who gets in?
- Imagined Futures
- Economic Immigrants (PR)
- Temporary Foreign Workers (Temporary Residents)
- Refugees
- Inclusion, Exclusion, and Subordination
### Immigration Policy as a Response to Demographic Changes
- Low Birth Rate
- 225-250k new immigrants brought in per year
Canadian immigration policy has slowly shifted from family-class (reunion status) and refugee-class, to economy-class (more temporary skilled workers)
### Immigration Policy in the Age of Neoliberalism
Between the 40s and 80s Canada was a welfare state, but from the 80s onwards, we are in a neoliberal government who opt to reduce welfare and privatize the economy.

In this era, it's all about the business and Canada is the brand of this business. And they will go at lengths to keep this economy afloat, even resorting to illegalizing immigrants. However this system is slow and inefficient and thus risk deskilling these skilled immigrants.

# Postwar Canada
- Postwar Ecnonomic Boom
- Leftward POlitical Shift
- Peacekeeping & Soft Power status
- Quebec spearatism.
## Newfoundland
Newfoundland allowed movement of arms from North America to Europe during the war. It was a government installed by the British. There was a ballot asking what Newfoundland wants.
1) Independence  
2) No independence  
3) Join Canada (favoured by Great Britain)  
4) Stronger relations and alliance with US
52% agreed to join Canada, 47% against. It was a close number so obviously there were lots of protest.
