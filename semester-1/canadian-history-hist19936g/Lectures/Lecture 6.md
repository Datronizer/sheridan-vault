# Canadian Immigration
## Background
### In Canada
The government eventually found out that a strip of land that spanned Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, is arable. So they need workers, but there wasn't enough Canadians.

This is when Canada decided to push for immigration, by sending promising posters to Europe to attract more farmhands to come build the new colonies. Ukrainians and Irish were some of the first few groups of people to settle Canada (more on this in next sections).
### Outside of Canada
#### Scientific Racism
Late 19 century is when Colonialism was at its peak. Colonialism is done with the intent of controlling a group of people for whatever purpose, mainly 2 reasons:
- Resources to extract
- A new market
This is basically what England did to Canada, where they would extract the resources from Canada, then they ship it to England, process it into consumer products, then sell it back to Canada. Of course this has always been the case, and still is now, under what we dubbed **neo-colonialism**.

People tend to forget that colonialism cannot just be done overnight, unless you can make up a good enough lie to your own people. In the past, the reason is religion. In 19 century, it gets a bit more complicated.
#### Justifying colonialism
To justify this brutal act, scientists claimed that races evolve, but some more evolved than others ([[Social Darwinism]]). And thus, whoever holds more power, is more evolved. Then, those who are more evolved should have a "moral obligation" to "uplift lesser races" through colonialism. This is called the "[[civilization mission]]". 

%% Read/watch Orientalism by Edward Sayd, it should have a lot of context to why racism is so prevalent nowadays. %%
#### "The Other"
## Choosing immigrants
Canada is a big land, she desperately needs immigrants. As one author puts it:
> The story of Canadian Immigration has been and remains both a catalyst to Canadian economic development and a mirror of Canadian attitudes and values; it has often been unashamedly and economically self-serving and ethnically or racially biased.

The main reason why there are many Ukrainian immigrants is because they are "preferred" immigrants. In fact here's the list in order of preference:
1. British
2. Americans
3. French
4. Scandinavians
5. Poles
6. Ukrainians
7. Spanish
8. Italians
9. Jews
10. Asians
11. Black people

Do you see a trend? They are choosing immigrants based on how culturally and racially similar they are to Canadians.

## Chinese Exclusion Act
The Chinese were brought to Canada to build the westward railways that allow Canada to colonize more land in Western provinces. But after the railways are done, they were no longer needed and was chased out. Of course they didn't want to, so the government decided to institutionally bar future Chinese from coming to Canada, deny voting rights, deny employments, and ban Chinese women (so Chinese men can't reproduce and grow their population).

This set of laws are passed through what is now called the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]

Oh yeah, this is fucked, but they don't talk about this eh?
## Nativism
Nativism is a concept where you feel like you belong to this land because you've lived here long enough. 

%% Read John Porter's Vertical Mosaic %%

## Immigration dilemma
A big dilemma was proposed: We need immigrants, but we want the preferred ones; yet these preferred immigrants don't want to work the jobs we want them to. 

What do we do then?

# Canada during WW1
## Competing national visions
Prior to 1896, Canada is a majority conservative country. The first prime minister MacDonald is a conservative. However, things were about to change after 1896. A new PM was voted and he was liberal. His name is Wilfrid Laurier, the first Francophone PM of Canada, liberal party. Between 1896-1914, multiple changes happened in Canada.

For one, the South African Boer War (1899 - 1902) created tensions over Canada's role in the British Empire. The British basically took out the Dutch empire in South Africa, and because they are at war, Canada is also automatically at war as a colony. English nationalists support the war, while French nationalists opposed the war.

In 1860s, the natives were the majority group, yet they were not listened to. But by 1911, they were only 3% because immigration skyrocketed. Thus their role became smaller and smaller in Canada's eyes.
## The New Industrial Order (1867 - 1914)
### Background
Thanks to the railway system, the economy roared into life and put Canada on the map. Protective tariffs and immigration are targeted towards the railway system to keep it going. But this growth isn't necessarily always good. %% Refer to image of slums in downtown Toronto %%

Mass production took out artisans and skilled labor in favor of cheap labor. These displaced artisans and poor people are called "luddites", and they are pissed. Oftentimes they'll sneak into factories at night and smash the machines because they took away the luddites' jobs. Because they represent change. And people don't like change.

Industrial changes also widened the growing gap between the rich and the poor, which is still happening today. That causes poverty and the people fight back in whatever way they can, in this case it's unions. God bless unions.

At the same time, politics takes an interesting turn. Conservatives, progressives, and radicals believe that the cause for this is from different things. Conservatives are very laissez-faire, leave things be. They claim that humans are imperfect and we should not attempt to perfect society. Progressives think otherwise, they want to implement social systems to help society become perfect. Radicals though, sheesh. They want to tear it all down and create a new and better system. 

Yes, communists are radicals in this case.
