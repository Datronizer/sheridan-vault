# Canada in the Era of World Wars
## The Great War and Reconstruction (1914 - 1921)
### Causes
Prior to the first World War, a lot of modern day countries didn't really exist. Back then they were huge empires spanning wide swaths of land. Main participants here are the Russian empire, the Austro-Hungarian empire, Prussia, France, Italian empire, and the Ottoman Turks. 

Around this time, alliances were formed. Some were unlikely, some were unexpected. The UK, France, and Russia were allied. Germany/Prussia, Austro-Hungaria, Italy were allies. Yes, you guessed it: Allies vs. Axis, because the latter was literally the "axis" of Europe (they cut through the continent).

Of course we learned that the "reason" for the war is the assassination of Archduke France Ferdinand with Philip Whateverhisfuckinglastnamewas. But that's not entirely accurate. Tensions have been steadily rising through the years leading up to the assassination. If it wasn't the assassination, it would still have happened within one or two years of that event. It was inevitable.

Imperialism was also rising in response to a race in resources, capitalism drives the economy.
##### Militarism
Empires become more militaristic. Conscription was widespread and was introduced in Europe late 19th century. It was like a sign of "we're about to fight". And people at the time were excited.
