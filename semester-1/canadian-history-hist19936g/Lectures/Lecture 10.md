Liberalization of social aspects. Social revolutions shaping Canadian future.

## Immigration and Aboriginal Self-Governance
Residential schools were still widespread.
After 1960s, the natives gained the rights to vote. But only after 1990s did they close the residential schools

## Quiet Revolution
Quebec elites believe that Quebec is different from the rest of the country, and thus drove the growth of nationalism. Quebec says it has been colonized by the Canadian Catholic church and England, so they wanted to fight back.

1958, Quebec adopts a new flag with the Fleur-de-lis to go against the British.

Pierre Trudeau v. Rene Levesque
Federalism v. Separatism

%% To hold a country together, you need an ideology to tie everyone together. In Quebec's case, it's nationalism. Rene Levesque - Parti Quebecois %%

# Canada At the End of History
## Quebec Sovereignty Movement
Trudeau reigns supreme in Ottawa
1980 Referendum on Separation failed so Quebec can't secede
Trudeau wanted to free Canada from England so he wanted to sign the Repatriation of the Constitution in 1982, rewriting the constitution after independence from British. Everyone agreed.

Except Quebec.

Quebec did not agree to this and never signed the repatriation. They still wanted to be independent.

In 1995, another referendum was done and failed, again.

There's a Province Party which is Parti Quebecois, now there's a Bloc Quebecois which is a federal party to claim more seats to change the political tides to force themselves into the system.

In 1993, the Conservatives messed up in 2 events called the Meech Lake Accord and the Charletown Accord. This allows BQ to rise to power and won the opposition.

Trudeau became extraoridinarily popular at the time after winning Canadian independence. It was literally called Trudeaumania. 

Mulroney v. Turner
In 1997, Mulroney called all the ministers to meet and negotiate for everyone to agree that Quebec needs special status in trade for special privileges for each province. Everyone thought this was dumb as fuck so no one agreed and the accord failed. This made French-English relations worse.

Reform Party of Canada to fight against "Western Alienation", was actually successful in gaining votes.

This bodied the conservatives all the way until 2008. Now the Liberals hold the majority even until now.
1995 Referendum has a lot of good documentaries. Famously known as the "yes v. no".

Harper v. Trudeau
Liberals v. NDP
