# The first explorers
The vikings were the first to reach the continent thousands of years before renaissance Europeans. Later, during the age of exploration, the Europeans travelled the world to seek out land to colonize using more advanced weapons and technology.

The Aztec empire was one of their first victims. They were one of the most powerful empires in the continent but were quickly wiped out by the Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors, two of the more powerful empires.

Around this time in the 17th century, the Dutch, English, and French landed in North America in search of power, self-governance, and resources like fish and fur. France actually successfully colonized a majority of North America.

Going back to Canada, our story begins with Jacques Cartier who landed in Quebec City and founded the first colonies of Canada.

# The English domination of Canada
## The early English colonies
Originally the English had only the 13 colonies of the United States, while the French influence reached all the way to Louisiana, from Quebec. These colonies are usually formed through relations with the natives rather than with force.
## The founding of Acadia and Quebec
Acadia is a colony now in Nova Scotia and it was one of the first to be founded in modern day Canada (1605). Quebec was founded 3 years later in 1608. To aid the process of colonization and get the natives' supports, the French used missionaries to spread Christianity to the native society. Using "the word of God", they could convince the natives to give up land and resources to expand their empire.

Around this time (1664), the British took over the Dutch territories and expanded their reach. Conflict was brewing and a war was bound to break out.
## New France
Louis XIV was one of the first kings to have centralized power to himself (l'etat, c'est moi). Mercantilism was how the empire operated, so they need lots of resources to trade, resources from Canada.

## 100-year war
Because of conflicts of interest, the English and French started warring with each other in 1663 and it only ended in 1763, where the French surrendered and withdrew all the forces to Quebec and back to France.

After the war, the English deported all the French, all 70,000 of them. 3,000 of them returned to Europe, not all made it. The other 67,000 remained and chose to become English citizens.

Unlike the English, France didn't care about New France and chose not to invest a lot of resources into it, thus being one of the main reasons for its fall.
