The Airport Metaphor is a really effective way to demystify the nature of networking and data communications. Generally, these are the associations you want to make:
- Data/Messages: yourself and your family members or your friends
- Nodes: Airports
- Interfaces: Security checkpoint, gates, etc.
- Sockets/Ports: Gates
- IP addresses: Starting location - Destination
- MAC addresses: Airport codes
