# IT Fundamentals & Technical Skills
Cybersecurity excellence is based on robust IT fundamental skills:
- Hardware
- OS
- Networking
- Programming
- Databases
- CLoud

## Hardware
Hardware knowledge is the first base to know about what makes up a computer system. Each piece of hardware is responsible for inputting, storing information necessary for the system to function.

Monitoring hardware components is necessary to prevent unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data. Knowing the fundamentals can also aid in idenfitying threats/vulnerabillityes (malware)

## Operating Systems
Operating systems are bridges between hardware and software running on your computer. An OS manages hardware and software resources, providing a range of services for different apps to run on a device. Manages use of hardware among programs. Controls memory, prioritizing requests, controls input and outputs, manages file systems. 

Understanding how OSes work helps csec professionals detect abnormalities, handle vulnerabilities and defends systems. This includes managing privs, system updates/patches.
## Networking
Networking refers to linking 2 or more devices to share data. Involves network design, construction , and use, encompassing various tech, devices, protocols. This forms the basics of data exchange in the digital world. Cyber threats target network vulnerabilities. It's important to understand how data transfers, and how different network components interact to secure the systems.
## Programming
A rudimentary grasp of programming is essential. Programming creates instructions for computers to execute to do some task. Involves writing, testing, debugging, uses a programming language.

Cybersecurity jobs don't require programming, but it helps if you understand the basics of coding to automate some tasks, identify vulnerabilities, and understand attack vectors. Knowing these enables dev of tools for pentesting and discovering/fixing sec vulnerabilities.
## Database
Important due to sensitive nature of data stored within. A DB is a structured set of data organized to facilitate efficient [[CRUD]] operations. Backbone of many apps, storing lots of infomation. UNderstanding this allows you to protect data and prevent unathorized access and breaches.

Knowledge of SQL/NoSQL, encryption, access controls is valuable for csec practitioners.
## Cloud
Forms basis for modern IT security. Cloud is a tech model that enables on demand access to shared computing pool: network,s ervers. etc.

Allows upscaling without much management effort. As more businesses migrate to cloud, the potential for cyber threats rises. Knowing cloud and shared sec models, and best practices for securiting cloud envs can enhance ablity to safeguard data.

# Importance of Cybersecurity Technical Skills
Includes infosys, secops, cryptography, risk management, threat analysis, authentication, network sec.

## Information Systems and Assurance
Infosys and assurance (ISA) is the cornerstone of cybersecurity. ISA refers to the practices and measures to protect (non)digital information from unauthorized access/use/disclosure/disruption/modification/destruction. As volume of digi data increases exponentially, the need for pros who can ensure the [[CIA Triad]]. Implements user policies, managing user access controls, and conducting regular audits to ensure compliance.

## Security Operations
Refers to actions dedicated to identifying, investigating, and resolving security incidents within an organizations information system. CSEC pros maintain and monitor security infrastructure, conduct incident response activities and collaborate with other teams to manage security incidents effectively.
## Cryptography
Science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format. Provides CIA (the A here is authenticity instead) in an insecure environment. Cryptographers create algorithms and ciphers to encrypt data, making it unreadable to everyone, except the decryption key holder.

CSEC pros need to understand the fundamentals of cryptography: (a)symmetric encryption, hashing/digital signatures. Must be familiar with encryption protocols to secure data in transit/at rest. Be aware of potential vulnerabilities can arise if they don't use protocols correctly. They should understand how to manage encryption keys, including the processes of essential generation, distribution, storage, and exploration.
## Risk management
Risk is born from uncertainty in info and tech. Risk management identifies, assesses, and prioritizes risks. Then they implement resources to minimize the impact of these risks. In CSEC, it means understanding potentital threats to an org's infosys and making informed decisions to mitigate said risks. Conduct risk assesments, create risk mitigation strats, and monitor effectiveness of said strats.

Csec pros use threat management to prevent attacks, detect threats and respond to sec incidents. Threat hunting proactively identifies and isolates threats that automated sec solutions didn't catch. Requires deep understanding of the org's network, including normal/abnormal behaviors => uncovering malicious activities.

Csec pros use threat intelligence analytics and up to date threat data to actively search analyze and remediate threats.
## Vulnerability management 
Continuously discorvering, prioritizing, and resolving sec vulns in the orgs hardware. Helps orgs stay ahead of attackers. Includes vulnerability scanning (using tools to detect them), penetration testing (simulating hacker activities and understand impact if exploited)
## Authentication
Verifies the identity of user, device or system. Fundamental aspect of access control, ensuring only authorized users/systems can access certain resources. Skills in designing systems like MFA, Biometrics, and digicerts are essential in  preventing unauthorized access and data breaches.
## What industry leaders are looking for
- People who contribute to FOSS / open-source communities, e.g. security shepherd.
- Awareness of hacker tools.
- Exposure to enterprise level tools.
- Go to CTF tournaments
- Understanding types of sec issues and common exploits
- Use a wide range of csec tools and understand why to use them
- Read and understand codes
- Critical thinking (think about how a system works and how it would fail)
- Balance crtical thinking with some flexibility (cant say no all the time, think of other ways to be safe)
- Integration testing
- (if going into implmentation) firewalls

while technical skills are important, you can't ignore the role of communication. Soft skills refer to personal attributes, interpersonal capabilities, and social attitudes that allow individuals to interact effectively with others.
## Attention to detail
Scrutinize data & systems to identify potential vulnerabillities/threats. Creativity & Critical thinking are also important to adapt to smarter attackers and outmaneuver them. Anticipate potential attack strats and develop countermeasures.
## Teamwork and Leadership
Communication, both written and verbal, are essential since csec is a field that requires coordination for a successful defense strategy. Effective communication ensures that every team member is aware of potential threats, status of ongoing tasks, and changes in strats. Leadership goes hand in hand with problem solving.

A team lead3er must guide their team through challenges, make important calls, and resolve disputes.
## Documentation
Keeping meticulous records of threats, breaches, and countermeasures provide valuable references for future occurences.
## Professionalism
Crucial, involves observing work ethics, maintaining confidentitality, respecting rules and regulations of the profession. The csec field involves securing digital assets and sensitive data => pros must maintain high integrity and responsibility
## Research
Pivotal in threat hunting. By researching modern trends, threat hunters can anticipate evolving strats that adversaries may use (research can include studying recent case studies, understanding new exploits, learning about latest sec tools) => spot anomalies.
## Time Management
Every second counts. Speed at which a threat is id'ed, eval'ed, and responded can significantly impact the extent of the damage a breach can cause. Response time delays can provide attackers a crucial window to infil systems, access sensitive info and wreak havoc.

Swift detection and response can mitigate threats, minimize damage, and prevent potential breaches. Pros must know to prioritize tasks, delegate when necessary, work efficiently to prevent/mitigate breaches
## Expert opinion
- Most important skill: listening. Translate what you hear into a message. 
	- Devs are constantly under pressure. Balance fixing and releasing to not stress them out
	- Listen to make arguments on why you need something to be done instead
	- Articulate the need to fix (people will only listen if you articulate)
	- Understand business drivers, listen to business person, and articulate what will happen if they don't fix
- Communication, problem solving, adaptability, lifelong learning
	- Explain complex technical knowledge to both tech/non-tech stakeholders
	- Identify, analysie. mitigate vulnerabilities
	- Adapt to new threats and tech changes, regulatory changes. Just be ready for change
- Interpersonal skills
	- Listen to others
	- Present ideas clearly
- Effective communication
	- Speak and write clearly
	- Express ideas confidently
	- Learn social skills and emotional intelligence
	- Read the room and know when to speak
	- Learn to speak business. If you can't explain things in business terms, they will not fund you, and your changes will not happen.
- 2 sides of csec:
	- UNderstand alerts and tech frameworks to avoid intrusions
	- Focus on understanding tech you're working with (IBM, Microsoft, Splunk, etc.), understand the capabilities of your tools.
	- Utilize built in AI to aid your line of work.
- Listen and understand:
	- Recognize reqs and problem statements
	- Tailor security to org needs and explain that to top management
		- If they can't see value, you get nothing.

# Certifications
Validates skills and knowledge in csec, opens opportunities. Grants professional credibility & facilitates industry recognition, shows that you can keep pace with evolving landscape. Indicates you have proficiency with most recent best practices and strats.

Combine cert + degree: huge boost in this shit ass market (certs show you have specific knowledge and skillset in csec, so you stand out more)

Some certs can replace a degree since they also provide credibility and discipline to achieve goals

For pros, can lead to promotions and higher level responsibilities. Implies commitment to continuous learning => good. Bridges gaps between skill and reqs.

Personal validation also, pretty satisfying.

Opens oppotunities for networking and professional communites. Cert bodies host webinars and other stuff so certified pros can interact and exchange ideas with peers. And we know how good networking is.

Certs have global recognition, so you have higher mobility with international clients.
