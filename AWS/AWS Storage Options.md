# Data Lake
## Introduction
A data lake can be considered as a **centralized repository** to put whatever the fuck you want. You can store **structured** and **unstructured data** at any scale. You know, like a lake!

## Accepted data
A data lake stores:
- Relational data from:
	- Line of Business application
- Non-relational data from:
	- Mobile apps
	- IoT devices
	- Social Media

The data can be stored as is, without any need to structure the data first (this is unlike a SQL database where you have to type and structure them).
## Supported features
[[Analytics]] are run on the unstructured data sets stored in the data lake. These Analytics include:
- Dashboard Visualization
- Big Data Processing with High Performance Computing (HPC)
- Real Time Analytics
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Machine Learning (ML)

These analytics are used to provide business insights.
