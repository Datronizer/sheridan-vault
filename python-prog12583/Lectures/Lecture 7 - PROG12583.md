# Debugging
To debug in Python, click leftwards of the row numbers. You should see a red dot glow up wherever you click. This is called a **breakpoint**. Remember this name.

Now go to the debug menu, default shortcut is `Ctrl + Shift + D`. Hit **Run and Debug** and it should change the interface to a debugging one. The debugger will now speed through the whole code and stop at a breakpoint. It will show you all the variables that has been computed and assigned up to that point--the point where the code is intentionally stopped/taking a break (see? I told you the name comes back).

Debugging allows you to add breaks to your code so that you can iterate over it line by line to figure out where an error/bug could have occurred. A good programmer is an expert debugger as it saves you a ton of time fixing and gives you more time to improve on what you have.
