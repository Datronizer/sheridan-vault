The binary number system, as the name suggests, has only two numbers: 0 and 1. 

This number system was originally invented to bridge the language barrier between man and machine. Computers can only communicate in electric currents, which in turn can only either be on or off. Hence 0 and 1 are used to notate the presence of a current. 0 being no, 1 being yes.

As computers can only "speak" in 0s and 1s, we eventually had to come up with a methodical system to translate binary into decimal, and formulate the system's fundamental properties.
# In terms of pure math
The binary numbering doesn't mean much in terms of pure math since it is NOT a separate set. If anything it is more of a [[concepts/math/Number Conversions|representation of numbers]]. It is in fact just the set $\mathbb{Z}$ which we know is a Group.
# In terms of discrete math
Binary numbering system is an expansion of [[concepts/math/Boolean Algebra]]. While Boolean algebra focuses on the computation of logic, binary numbering focuses on presenting [[concepts/math/Decimals]] in terms of 0s and 1s for computers to understand. Yes, binary is in fact one of the centerpieces of discrete math as this is how computers communicate with one another. Lots of research has been done on the mathematical foundations of such a field, and generally, the information coincides with that of pure math.
