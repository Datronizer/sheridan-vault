# Logic Gates
All our knowledge about [[Boolean Algebra]] can finally be put into practice. Introducing **logic gates**, semiconductors designed to compute Boolean algebra such that a computer can process information from 0s and 1s. 

All illustrations are on the lecture. Please refer for diagrams and examples.

Verbal explanation of all gates:
- OR gate: Rectangle with a semicircle cut off of 1 side and shifted to the opposite side, looks like a ticket.
- AND gate: Rectangle + semicircle, looks like a tunnel.
- NOT gate: Triangle + circle at tip.
- NAND gate: NOT of the AND term. Represented as an AND gate + a teeny circle where the AND outputs.
- NOR gate: NOT of the OR term. Represented as an OR gate + a teeny circle where the OR outputs.
- XOR gate: Looks like OR but there's an extra line hugging the input curvature.

Diagrams are often drawn from left to right for clarity. Usually you can draw everything by hand, which if you know me, I don't prefer. However, there exists a site called [logic.ly](https://logic.ly) that you can use to graph these diagrams.

Here's an illustration for clarity's sake
