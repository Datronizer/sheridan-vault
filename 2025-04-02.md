vs
![[Pasted image 20250402114800.png]]prolly asks for what game you want for your client 

allows creation of account on the payment site=> routes that to our backend => routes back to payment services => punch in transaction details => send to Stripe

The amount and game should be processed first before that info is sent to NextPay. Then in NextPay, show the gameroom based on the template we make. When the user is ready to pay, send them to Stripe's premade website.

Add verfiication to Deposit Template.

Template should remember user's email. The email is locked to only one venue.

Try the feature out here:
https://pay.binpay.me/dynasty-gameroom/deposit

The slug for this tells you what venue/brand it is

Registering an account on here will send you a verification email. After verifying your email, your account will be added to the partner site's backend, pending approval.

And after the brand approves, you can use their brand's site.

** ticket should be email

# Feature: Blacklist

Call center will use our system to host all gamerooms. For this, we'll need a blacklist system to ban accounts and relevant accounts.

Notes ( ban reason)

Added to call center to figure out what's going on between call centers
Need to design tools for operators, to assist gamerooms and call centers

Use FB ID to identify fraud based on our blacklist form.

The blacklist form is used to query for names and FB ID (the tag), and notes, to see if we blacklisted someone and reason.

Blacklist search engine to prevent scammers



# My ideas for Stripe:
First we request all the info from the Deposit Form
Once we have all the info, store it somewhere and go to the transaction page.
Make a transaction and send the stored info alongside with (stored info includes client secret so we know what transaction it's from).
If transaction succeeds, we generate a Deposit Ticket for the Call Center. Else make user retry payment.



THe Server Provider is just whatever game accounts they are. Like Juwa
Username is whatever name the user uses to log into the game (not the Management platfirm.)

The worker must bve allowed to enter the user data including Facebook.
Same email/facebook ID between accounts. But usernames can be different. (we NEED email and FB ID)

# verification
needs account verification
