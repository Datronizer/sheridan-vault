Let's say I have some arbitrary number. Let's say the number is 5678. How many ways can I express this number?

Well I can do
$$
\begin{align}
5678 &= 5.678 \times 10^3 \\
&= 56.78 \times 10^2 \\
&= 567.8 \times 10^1 \\
&= 5678 \times 10^0 \\
&= 56780 \times 10^{-1} \\
&= 567800 \times 10^{-2} \\
\end{align}
$$
and these would all be equivalent. As you can see, all these numbers can be represented using 3 parts:
- A decimal with a decimal point that "floats" around (significand)
- A base of 10 (base)
- An exponent of 10 (exponent)
