Stress (external)
- Focus on what you have control over which is only yourself.
- Problem solve (what can I do?)
- Accept reality
- Seek support 
- Self care, nutrition, exercise
- General stress reduction activities
- Skill build (for me: procrastination skills, relaxing skills for sleep)
- "Just for today" (one thing at a time, take care of what we can for today)

Anxiety (internal)
