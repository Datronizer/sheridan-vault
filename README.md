# Info
This is Chien's personal vault where he stores all his lecture notes and related concepts. Treat this like a Wikipedia, but for my (Chien's) personal reference.

Here you will find notes, explanations, relevant articles, hyperlinks to other media. Textbooks might be included for some classes, or you can request them directly from me at tqc1234@gmail.com. 
# Textbooks
Textbooks are included within this vault. Some of which might not have been legally acquired. Please exercise caution as not to leak this vault or we all lose these textbooks.

Since Obsidian is built using [[Chromium]], it includes a PDF reader. Meaning you can read these books directly through here. 
# Web viewer
I'm currently working on a web viewer for these notes so that you can access these notes on the fly. Expect it to be available soon on my [personal website](https://trueongod.com) or my [Netlify web app](https://trueongod.netlify.app). Ideally these two links should lead to the same source.
# External sources
## MIT's Open Courseware
A really good source of external courseware or information that is super detailed and free is [MIT's Open Courseware (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu). If you ever need to look up information related to technology FOR FREE, go there.

Some information might be too complicated for starters but if you're looking to go in-depth into a language or concepts, there is no better source out there than OCW.
## GeekForGeeks
[GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) is a wonderful source of information when you just started your programming career. They include very simple explanations of concepts that seem arbitrary at first glance. And yes they have almost every bit of information on most popular languages.

Examples are often provided and they usually include multiple different cases in case you wonder how a function can be expanded and used in a different way.
## W3Schools
Of course, we always have to mention [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). They are an amazing source for anything web development or if you are just starting out. Typically all their tutorials have examples that you can practice with. I'd easily rank this number 1.
## Humble Bundle
This is a charity site where you can buy a ton of games for $15-30 (I once bought 300 games for $5). Anyways, [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books) sometimes have programming book sets that you can buy for a measly $15. Most of the books I include in this repo are actually from there! Go give them a try!
# FAQs
## I see that an entry overlaps between 2 fields, how do you structure these?
Some contents from different fields can overlap, this is almost unavoidable as knowledge is seldom distinct. There are always connections between concepts. For these overlapping content, I will often force them into 1 field based on how conceptually relevant they are to that field or whether the overlapped fields are forks of one of the other fields.

**For example:** the scientific notation for decimal numbers overlaps physics, math, and computer science. But since it is conceptually math (because of numbers) and since both physics and computer science stem from maths, the information will be stored in the `math` folder.

However, some fields are literally so overlapped there is no other way but to split that entry into 1 for each overlapping field.

**For example:** operators (plus, minus, etc.) are both in math and CS. But because their concepts are so intertwined, explaining it in one entry will be too much. It's better to split it into `Operators (Math)` and `Operators (CS)`. In that case, I can keep their concepts separate while also linking them together.
## What happens to old lectures?
Since SLATE locks old classes after the term ends, I didn't see a point in keeping the information separated by classes. So, when the classes are locked, I will migrate all the information to the `concepts` folder and rewrite/restructure them so the information is more general and cross-linked to other concepts rather than weekly lectures.
