Not to be confused with "an internet", The Internet is what we call the network of networks, connected globally on Earth, which houses trillions of bytes of data, maybe more! The Internet is what I would like to call our "digital home".

To you, the Internet could be Instagram, Snapchat, iMessage where you can text your friends. To me, The Internet is where I can meet my friends online and we can hang out, play video games, etc.

Everyone's definition of the Internet is different. That's why it's personal and impersonal all the same.
