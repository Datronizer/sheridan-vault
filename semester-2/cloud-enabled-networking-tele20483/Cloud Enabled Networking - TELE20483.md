> [!important] This class is ridiculously hard. Very high failure rate. All grades will be strict. Please pay attention and take good notes. Good night and good luck! 

According to professor Ida Leung, half the class fails. To be honest, 50/50 is a good rate, we take those. To up our chances, professor Leung will provide bonus marks. These marks will be provided as such:
- 3 marks max for **attendance**
- 2 marks max for **finishing 75 of quizzes and assignments**

Late submissions will be deducted $(0.9)^d | \text{d being number of days late}$. 
All exams are in person. Test 1 is written only. Test 2 and 3 are both written (65%) and practice (35%).

The **class plan** will be attached in the root folder of this class. Click on "show in Explorer" to reveal it.
The **textbook** will be attached in the textbook folder.

If you want an AWS certification by the end of the class, you can consult [this book](https://www.amazon.ca/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Study-Guide/dp/1119713080). Of course, there will be a ["free" version](https://library.lol/main/B737706D838FA0EEACAE942B2CA7E609) but do make sure to access using Tor. Trust me. Anyways, if you want a physical copy, look up the ISBN: 978-1119713081.
