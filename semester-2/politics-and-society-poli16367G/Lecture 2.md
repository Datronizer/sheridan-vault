# Political power, Authority, and the State

## Power
Power is a tool to manipulate. Anything that can force/convince a person to do something has power.
Legitimate power: power that you consent to (paying for school to listen the teacher--figure of power)

Power is a central concept in politics. People in power can often set the agenda, so it is important to understand how power works.

One thing to remember is that power is often equated with coercion.

But [[#authority]] is often equated with consent.

However, there are alternatives to the use of coercion. You can rule through [[ideological control]] or through a conversion of **power** into **authority**
### Rule through Ideological Control
Manipulation of the preferences of the ruled to reflect the interests of the rule.
Eliminates the need for constant surveillance.
Associated with elitist thought and Marxist critiques of capitalism.
### Convert power to authority
Attempt to make the rule legitimate in the eyes of the rule
To do this requires an understanding of the basis for authority
How is legitimacy decided?
Although they can be treated as separate, all governments make use of both power and authority.
In practice, it can be difficult to draw a distinction between the two.
### Power = Force?
Power can be and often is expressed through force. But some argue that the use of force is an indicator that power has failed. 

According to Stephen Lukes: "having the means of power is not the same thing as being powerful."
### Must power be exercised deliberately
That's... debatable. According to Russell:
> Power is the production of intended results: the unforeseen effects of our influence on other cannot be called power

But according to Polsby:
> 
### Is power good?
This is arugable. If you use power to productively transform, it's good. But if you use power to harm, it's bad. Liberals often see power as undesirable because it "involves the imposition of someone's values upon another" (Barry, 2000).
### Can we eliminate power?
Thinkers like Habermas, Lukes, and Marcuse argue that power needs to be kept in check because it is illegitimately used.

Foucault argues that power is unavoidable.

Power is not something that you "have" or "don't have"--it is part of all relationships

Foucault suggests that can work to free themselves from domination; but first, they have to recognise that dominance.

Some societies have worked out ways to reduce the power of individual leaders and ensure that political power is spread out as much as possible within a community.

For many Indigenous peoples, good leadership is temporary, based on particular circumstances and needs or the gifts of the leader, and followers are under no obligation to follow once the particular task of the temporary leader has been accomplished.

## Power and the State
Theorist Lukes identified 3 dimensions of power.
### The first face of power
"A has power over B to the extent that he can get B to do something that B would not otherwise do" (Dahl).
Pluralists argue that , although certain groups might exercise power in specific areas, no single group will dominate across the range of policy-making.
The exercise of power is observable and subject to empirical analysis.
#### Criticisms of the First Face of Power
Pluralists understanding of power miss at lease 3 things:
- No allowance for the face that some issue areas are more important than others
- Assumption that the barriers to political participation are low
- Ignores the possibilities that the most important issues may even be discussed as they may be kept off the agenda by elite groups.
### The second face of power
Power is also exercised in less obvious ways, such as when a dominant elite keeps issues that might threaten its position off of the public agenda.
Bachrach and Baratz (1962)
Therefore we have to consider "non decision-making" as well, which makes empirical analysis more difficult.
### The third face of power
The first 2 faces of power assume that the political actors are aware of the their own interests. However, this may not be the case.

"A may exercise power over B by getting him to do what he does not want to do, but he also exercises power over him by influencing, shaping, or determining his very wants" (Lukes, 2005).

Argues that powerful groups can prevent their potential opponents from understanding where their true interests lie.

#### Criticisms of the Third Face of Power
- Very hard to verify empirically
- Rests on the idea that people have "real" interests which can be distinguished from the ones which they express.
- Closely related to the Marxist idea of "false consciousness"
	- Asserts that the ruling class manipulites the thought process of the labouring class.

### Interests and Power
The Third Face of Power implies that there can be a difference between perceived interest and actual interest. But this isn't easy to determine.
Hazard of adopting a patronizing "we know best" mentality
Some dominated groups may only appear to accept the dominant world-view while promoting a counter-culture of their own.

### Socialism and Power
The socialist critique of the modern industrial state and its inqualities remains powerful and persuasive for many people.
Gramsci develops the concept of "hegemony"
Those in power do not only determine what is legal and illegal, they also determine what is normal and abnormal.
Marcuse argues that the so-called "benign" or "beneficial" state may act violently against the inerests of its citizens sometimes.
## State 
A state is a power apparatus. The government and all its branches and tiers will make up a state. For example: Canada has 3 governments:
- Federal government
	- Study permits, work permits, etc.
- Provincial government
	- Driver's license, etc.
- Municipal government
	- Water, power, etc.

All these are parts of a state.
## Authority
## Weber's 3 types of Authority
1. Traditional authority: based on traditional customs and values such as the divine right of kings.
2. Charismatic authority: based on the personal characteristics of the ruler, often associated with authoritarian and totalitarian societies.
3. Legal-rational authority: based on the status of the office within a constitutional structure.
