All assignments are individually done with no cooperations, unique work only, no dupes.

The practical/hands-on exam is open book and open notes. You will be completing a set of tasks in Linux in the allotted time. The only restriction is that your work must be yours and uniquely yours.

The contents for the final exam are cumulative. In other words, study **everything**. This applies to both the theory and hands-on part.

Sheridan has recently implemented the [[Sheridan College#50/50 rule|50/50 rule]] for this course. Nikolai says he has no idea why. I believe him lol.
