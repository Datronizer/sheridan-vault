The practical/hands-on exam is open book and open notes. You will be completing a set of tasks in Linux in the allotted time. The only restriction is that your work must be yours and uniquely yours.

The contents for the final exam are cumulative. In other words, study **everything**. This applies to both the theory and hands-on part.
