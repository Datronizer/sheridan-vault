# Atlas
Instead of installing VMWare and wanting to kms, we can access Sheridan's Linux server--Atlas.

Unfortunately for the *aesthetic girlies* (me), there is no GUI. Everything will be done through Command-Line Interface (CLI). Unfortunately for the *artistic girlies* (me tambien)

To connect to the Sheridan Linux server, do the following in your terminal:
```
ssh [YOUR_SHERIDAN_ID]@atlas.sheridanc.on.ca
```
# OpenStack
OpenStack is a very powerful virtualization environment. We can use this for the purposes of this class also.
