# Try-catch
Oh yeah, this bad boy? This bad boy is useful.

A `try-catch` block is a control block which will attempt to do something and if that doesn't work, it catches the error and does something with it.

You're probably asking, "what's wrong with just letting the error happen?" Well when an error is thrown, the whole program crashes by default. If you want to keep the program running even after the crash, you'll need to force it to catch the error before it hits the termination command.

The name of the block kind of makes sense. **Try** something, if it doesn't work **catch** the error before it terminates the code.
