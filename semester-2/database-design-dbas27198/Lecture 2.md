# Bubble Diagram
Let's say you have 4 entities: Student, Program, Course, Teacher. Now put each of these entities in their own bubbles. Okay, now we link attributes.

A student can enrol in multiple courses, and a course can have many students. Draw an arrow with double heads linking Student to Course and Course to Student (same line).

Now look at program. A program has many students but a student can only enrol in 1 program. Do a double arrowhead from Program to Student, single arrowhead from Student to Program.

A Teacher can teach multiple Courses and a Course and have multiple teachers. Double arrowhead, double sided. 

A course can be in many Programs and vice versa. Double double.

> [!important] Drawing Notes
> 
> - All arrow ends must have either a single or double arrow head. 
> - No curved arrows allowed. 
> - Lines should never cross unless absolutely unavoidable
