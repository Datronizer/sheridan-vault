The prof will play his [class recordings](https://2299061.kaf.kaltura.com/channel/1283656/355475782) during class and add extra info. These recordings will be available online as well. Thus, sometimes his class will be online. In that case, check announcements a week beforehand (man I'm still gonna have to come to campus anyways)
