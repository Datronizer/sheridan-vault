# Java Collections Framework
We have the concept of an Object. We see that irl, there are lots of variations of objects, and variations of those variations. We implemented something similar in [[Object-Oriented Programming|OOP]], where we have a class, and we can instantialize it as clones of the same object, albeit with some variations.

We can create these objects with constructors and refer to them as Simple Objects.

In the field, we tend to talk about many objects with the same reference. That is a Class. 

Now suppose I'm going somewhere to buy something, at some point, my ass will end up in a *queue*.

Suppose I have a bunch of classes, with specific time, date, etc., those are in a *schedule*.

All these are examples of [[Collections]]--or Containers, a concept in Java that is used to describe a collection of uniquely identified objects that share the same type, and follow specific pre-existing conditions. The objects that belong in a collection are called [[Collection Objects]]. 

To work with these collections, developers came up with some libraries to help you out. All these libraries (collection of classes) are called [[Collection Frameworks]], in our case, *Java Collections Framework*.
