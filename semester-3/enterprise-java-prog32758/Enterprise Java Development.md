### Assignments Explanation
Class examples are used as learning tools.  There are 5 class examples with required submission. Submissions on time grant 3% bonus.

Exams will not have any multiple choices. Instead there will be "code analyses", where you look for what's wrong with the code, or explain how it works.
# Course Materials
There are no textbooks for this class, [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/org-springframework) will serve as a good reference for the work we'll be doing.
