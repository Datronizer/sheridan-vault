First thing, coding software is not the same is making a commercial software. These are 2 different things. Remember that companies want profit about all else, and if they don't sell code, the money their product pulls in should be higher than the cost.

In a way, software is a business. When you build a software, it must be complete well and fast. If it isn't, oh boy, get ready to eat shit because they are not paying you. 

Development is extremely expensive. For companies to survive, your software needs to be predictable, efficient (no dupes, no unnecessary shit, everyone has max productivity), needs to meet client expectation, and needs to be near perfect before shipping.

Software dev in work is completely different from school. Things are stricter, more bullshit, and products need to be perfect.

So how do we maintain this standard?
# Software Development Life Cycle
## Software delivery phases
Regardless of the methodology, they're all built around the same concepts and phases:
1. Analysis (Idea Conception): Determine what you ned
2. Design: Draft what you want on the product
3. Dev: Make the product
4. QA Testing (Deliver to Client): Make sure the product does what it needs to do without issues
5. Client Testing ()

### Analyses
Requiremenst are not easy, they kinda suck actually. Usually the client would describe what they want and you write that down. But these LOSERS DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN SHIT. They overexplain, underexplain, be rude, be absent. 

There needs to be a way to syncronize these two, which is to attack.

A Requirement is something the system must do to function correctly. Use cases are own watasnj=
