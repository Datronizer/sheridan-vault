5 years ago this wasn't really big but now it's massive. It has now become the forefront of computer science. 3 things that drive this is
1. Computing power
2. Existence of algorithms (particularly [[Machine Learning|ML]] algorithms)
3. Abundance of data (like wayyyyy too much data)
# 4 Approaches to Artificial Intelligence
There are 4 approaches to AI, each of which represent a goal of some sort for computer scientists over time. These goals are represented in chronological order of when they were conceived.
## Thinking Humanly
**Cognitive Model Approach**:
- Mimic human thinking, by learning how human minds work
- Once we know how it works, we can express a program that represents that theory

Ideally, a complete model, when providing an input will spit back an output that resembles how humans behave.

Problem is humans don't often act rational. We're emotional beings and our decisions don't necessarily do things the way we expect them. So maybe, AI should be thinking rationally instead.
## Acting Humanly
[The Turing Test](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-test/) is an important idea in the realm of AI, because it is a basis on which we can determine if an artificial agent can pass as a human (is human enough that we can't discern).

There are 4 things that we can use to fail an artificial agent:
1. Natural Language Processing: Machines to communicate text, speech
2. Knowledge presentation: The act of storing knowledge
3. Automated Reasoning: Come to conclusions based on their stored knowledge
4. Machine Learning: Ability to adapt, infer, or detect patterns

There's also a Total Turing Test. As compared to the Turing Test which literally just involves conversing, the Total Turing Test looks as the full scope including physical interaction.
## Thinking Rationally 
**Logical Rules Approach:**
All decisions are made based on syllogisms, such as if-else, if-then, deductive/inductive arguments. 

This is a very bad approach since it's too reductionist and life is seldom as simple as the model suggests. In short: One cannot reduce all decisions to a set of premises and conclusions.
## Acting Rationally
You can't always prove a decision is correct, but you must choose. Not all rationality can be based on logical rules. Not all rational actions need to be logical.

This model is made based on the weaknesses of the prior models. This is the current approach for modern agents.
# Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about building computer programs that act rationally (intelligent agents). AI is a computer program but not otherwise. AI distinguishes itself from mere programs by
- Operating automously
- ska
- mam
# Machine Learning
Machines that learn rather than being programmed. Optimization and finding the best solution to a program, seeing patterns in data. Generalizing data.

## Creating a Model
Data => MLA => Output (prediction)
How do we know if the prediction is good? We apply a Test Data that is completely different from what you train it with. If we get a good accuracy from that, we can say that it's a good model.

**Example:**
Suppose a have a table of 1000 rows of cars with their models, engines, and prices. Now suppose we plug let's say... 700 random rows into an MLA, whatever the model is. The MLA will return a prediction model. 

In this case, we still have 300 models left to test. We can throw this data into the prediction model and crosscheck the answer. Eventually the model will learn the pattern and will be accurate over time.

# Data Science / Engineering
Analysing Data
Processsing Data (and pre-processing)
Visualisation of data => Charts/Graphs
# Big Data
A lot of data

ML encompasses data, and thus it is directly related to data science / engineering and big data
ML is also a subset of AI
