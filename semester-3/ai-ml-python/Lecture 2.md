Data is the fundamental unit of programming. Even the most primitive programs contain data. Yes, `Hello World!` is also data.

One thing we need to do is to store data. There are 2 types: persistent data (files, etc.) and non-persistent data (in memory, wiped when session over)
- Non-persistent: Arrays

# [[Intermediate Datatypes#Lists (Arrays)|Arrays]]
Strongly typed, indexed, contiguous in [[Memory & Compiler Maps|memory]] (unlike [[Advanced Data Types#Linked Lists|Linked Lists]]), collection of data.

In contrast, a Python List is weak typed. For numerical arrays in Python, the use of `numpy` is encouraged.
# [[Advanced Data Types#Data Frame|Data Frames]]
numpy is good for arrays
pandas are animals in china (*jk*). `pandas` allows the creation and manipulation of objects from data frames.
Pandas Series is basically all the data in a column, indexes of which can be whatever. It's basically an array but `pandas`.

In a data frame, `index` are row names, `columns` are, well, column names.
