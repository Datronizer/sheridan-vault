# IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)
This is basically a singleton / anonymous function / lambda that immediately invokes upon declaration. Which of course you could just, yk, use an arrow function?

`( function() { /* Some code here */ } )()`
The outer parentheses wraps the function and allow it to immediately be invoked using a pair of parentheses after.
