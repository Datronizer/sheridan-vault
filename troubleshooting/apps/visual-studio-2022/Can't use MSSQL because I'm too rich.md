# Symptoms
If you managed to find this file, I'm almost certain you are already suicidal from diagnosing this shit for 48 hours. I know I did.

You're here because
- VS2022 REFUSES to connect to MSSQL
- It throws a dumbass, nonexistent, non-searchable error
- Event Manager throws error 51, which is a generic fuckin error
- Or you're a victim of ALL 6 OF THE SCENARIOS LISTED [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/database-file-operations/troubleshoot-os-4kb-disk-sector-size?tabs=registry-editor)
- Btw, any of these scenarios COULD BE A SYMPTOM OF SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WHICH FUCKING SUCKS.
# Causes
Do you own a Windows 11 laptop that happens to contain an M.2. NVMe SSD? You do? Oh boy you are so fucked.

My friend, YOU are the problem.
# Solution
Bro I can't even begin to tell you how this even fucking happened.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/database-file-operations/troubleshoot-os-4kb-disk-sector-size?tabs=registry-editor

Even more so, someone fucking found it only recently and no patches were pushed.
1. Run Registry Editor as an administrator.
2. Navigate to `Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\stornvme\Parameters\Device`.
3. Select **Edit** > **New** > **Multi-String value** and name it as `ForcedPhysicalSectorSizeInBytes`.
4. Right-click the name, select **Modify**, and type `* 4095` in the **Value data** field.
5. Select **OK** and close Registry Editor.
# Explanation
## tl;dr
This bug is there because VS2022 devs have brain damage and can't fathom for a second that maybe hard-coding block sizes in 2025 is delusional at best.
## Full explanation
This error is from the way modern SSDs, NVMe's specifically, handle file system sector sizes. A typical sector size is 4096 B, or 4 KB. This is the standard for the longest time... until SSDs arrived.

SSDs, turns out, supports 8 KB and 16 KB due to its construction, and actually prefers those over 4 KB. MSSQL on the other hand, is hardcoded to partition your storage in 4 KB blocks. Why there hasn't been a compatibility update yet in 2025 is beyond me.

> During service startup, SQL Server begins the database recovery process to ensure database consistency. Part of this database recovery process involves consistency checks on the underlying filesystem before you try to open system and user database files.
> 
> Some new storage devices and device drivers expose a disk sector size greater than the supported 4-KB sector size.
> 
> When this issue occurs, SQL Server is unable to start due to the unsupported file system as SQL Server currently supports sector storage sizes of 512 bytes and 4 KB.

Comedic fucking level error btw.

Which means, at some point, while creating the Database, MSSQL will run into an 8KB block, gets confused as shit and throws a wrench in the whole thing and brick itself. But for SOME FUCKING REASON, THIS ERROR DOESN'T HAVE AN ERROR CODE. MEANING ALL THE ERROR CODES YOU DO GET ARE GENERIC AS FUCK AND REFER TO LIKE 8 SIMILAR ISSUES.

The solution is also incredibly brain-damaged. You'll have to fucking go into RegEdit and add a variable to "simulate" 4 KB. Once you've done that, restart your laptop and your MSSQL should work.

Brother... it gets worse

> Windows 11 native NVMe drivers were updated to include the actual sector size reported directly by the NVMe storage devices. This was done rather than relying on the information that's emulated from the filesystem drivers.
> 
> The Windows 10 drivers don't report the source sector size of the physical storage.
> 
> The improved Windows 11 drivers disregard the emulation that common NVMe storage devices are using. As an example, `fsutil` displays a sector size of 8 KB or 16 KB, rather than emulating the required 4-KB sector size required by Windows.

The reason why my shit broke... was because Windows 11 didn't even bother emulating for accuracy, and the accuracy broke my shit.
