Universal Resource Identifier

This requires the protocol, the webserver, the application root directory, the sub directories, and the web resource.

Example is such
`https://www.google.ca/images/some-image-name-here.png?dateUploaded=blahblahblah` ^60c975
- `https://` is the protocol
- `www.google.ca` is the web server
- `/images` is the application root directory
- `/some-image-name-here.png` is the resource I'm looking for
- `?dateUploaded=blahblahblah` is one key-value pair of a list of request parameters, separated from the URI by a `?`
