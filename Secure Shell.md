Secure Shell Connection (SSH) is a popular way to remotely connect into another device, through a terminal, using port 22.

# Device differences
All devices running UNIX-based OSes can connect to each other using SSH. This includes Apple, Linux, and Windows 10+.

In this case, Windows 10+ (10 or higher, not to be confused as its own OS) is equipped with SSH even though it's running MS-DOS.

Windows less than 10 use a proprietary thing called Remote Desktop Service (RDS, port 3389). We're just going to ignore them. You can literally just use PuTTY to bypass their dumbass.
