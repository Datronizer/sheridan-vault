# Info
This is Chien's personal vault where he stores all his lecture notes and related concepts. Treat this like a Wikipedia, but for my (Chien's) personal reference.

Here you will find notes, explanations, relevant articles, hyperlinks to other media. Textbooks might be included for some classes, or you can request them directly from me at tqc1234@gmail.com. 
# Textbooks
Textbooks are included within this vault. Some of which might not have been legally acquired. Please exercise caution as not to leak this vault or we all lose these textbooks.

Since Obsidian is built using [[Chromium]], it includes a PDF reader. Meaning you can read these books directly through here. 
# Web viewer
I'm currently working on a web viewer for these notes so that you can access these notes on the fly. Expect it to be available soon on my [personal website](https://trueongod.com) or my [Netlify web app](https://trueongod.netlify.app). Ideally these two links should lead to the same source.
# External sources
## MIT's Open Courseware
A really good source of external courseware or information that is super detailed and free is [MIT's Open Courseware (OCW)](https://ocw.mit.edu). If you ever need to look up information related to technology FOR FREE, go there.
