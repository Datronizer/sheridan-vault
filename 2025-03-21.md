Member-Employee flow
1. User texts Employee about the account/credit
2.1. If Member account on our page is DNE, create a new NextPlay account
2.2. If exists, skip to 3

3. Create a sweepstakes account


Need a specialised Search Container
Need a phonebook function 

Allow user to create own account with data, and if we need to, employees can go in there and fix/add the data for the user.

Whenever you look for an account, it should show all the sweepstakes accounts for that user, and all the contact avenues.

Example:
When the user is identified and chosen from the search container, it should show their data as such

| Sweepstake     | Username     |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| SomeSweepstake | SomeUsername |
| Example2       | Subsection2  |
If the user doesn't have an account, it should automatically offer the employee to create a new account.

When the employee clicks on the row containing the sweepstake/username, it should send the employee to the add/withdraw sweepstakes credit slip where they log the operation. We can store the phases as a `[0,1,2,3]` array.

When we add credit slip, it minuses the user's balance and send that transaction to add into the credit slip. Withdraw does the opposite and goes back into the wallet.
